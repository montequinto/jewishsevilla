                        <h3>Historical background</h3>
                        Although tradition tells us about Jews living in Seville at the time of the destruction of the
                        first Temple (586 BCE) the presence of Jews in this city can only be verified at the time
                        of the Visigoths (VIth-VIIth centuries). When the city was conquered by the Moslems in
                        712 they formed a Jewish guard for its defense; these soldiers settled in the city and its
                        surroundings.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Under the Umayyad dinasty, Seville prospered and became an important cultural center.
                        The jews of Seville were engaged in commerce, medicine as well as the dyeing industry.
                        Seville then became one of the four major communities in Moslem Spain. After the
                        Berber conquest in 1013, Seville served as a refuge for jews escaping from Córdoba.
                        <br/><br/>
                        As it happened in other parts of Andalusia, the Almohade conquest in 1148 only brought
                        death and destruction to the jews. When Seville was reconquered by the Christians in
                        1248, the few jews that were still in the city welcomed them with open arms. For a period
                        of time, the Jewish community was revived and even Sevila became the second city of
                        Castilla with the higher number of jews, only after Toledo. Gradually, as the reconquest
                        succeeded, the Christians no longer needed money or help from the Jews, thus life
                        became increasingly more difficult.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Soon the fate of Spanish Jewry was brutally altered. In 1378, the archdeacon of Ecija,
                        Ferrant Martinez, launched a campaign of violent sermons against the Jews, demanding
                        the destruction of 23 local synagogues. Though he was repeatedly ordered to stop his
                        diatribes, Martinez succeeded in arousing passionate hatred among the masses. On
                        the death of the archbishop in 1390, he became virtual ruler of the diocese, using this
                        situation to intensify his anti-Jewish campaign.
                        <br/><br/>
                        A full-scale pogrom broke out on June 6, 1391. The infuriated populace attacked the
                        Aljama from all sides, plundering and burning the houses. Many fell victims to the mob's
                        fury, although most of the Jews accepted baptism to save their lives. At this point, the
                        so-called “jewish problem” became the “converso problem”. As a result, the once vibrant
                        community never recovered and, along with the other Jews of Andalusia, they were exiled
                        in 1483, 9 years before the final expulsion.

                    Travelling has given me the opportunity to meet other Jews, to share my personal story
                    with them and to compare the current Jewish Community of this city with theirs and other
                    communities.
                    By meeting jewish people from all over the world, I have realized how
                    miraculous the existence of Jewish life in Sevilla is.<br/><br/>
                    Now I would like to share my story and experiences with you!

                    By walking inside the former jewish quarter
                    of Sevilla, we will try to comprehend how our ancestors lived in this city until the edict of
                    expulsión was issued by King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella in 1492.
